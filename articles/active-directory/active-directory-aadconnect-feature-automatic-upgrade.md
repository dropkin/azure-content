# Azure AD Connect: Automatic upgrade
This feature was introduced with build 1.1.105.0 (released February 2016).

## Overview
Making sure your Azure AD Connect installation is always up to date has never been easier with the **automatic upgrade** feature. This feature is enabled by default for express installations and will make sure that when a new version is released, your installation is automatically upgraded.

Automatic upgrade is enabled by default for the following:

- Express settings installation
- Using SQL Express LocalDB , which is what Express settings will always use
- The AD account is the default MSOL_ account created by Express settings
- Have less than 100,000 objects in the metaverse

The current state of automatic upgrade can be viewed with the PowerShell cmdlet `Get-ADSyncAutoUpgrade`. It has the following states:

| State | Comment |
| ---- | ---- |
| Enabled | Automatic upgrade is enabled. |
| Suspended | Set by the system only. The system is no longer eligible to receive automatic upgrades. |
| Disabled | Automatic upgrade is disabled. |

You can change between **Enabled** and **Disabled** with `Set-ADSyncAutoUpgrade`. Only the system should set the state **Suspended**.

Automatic upgrade is using Azure AD Connect Health as the upgrade infrastructure. For automatic upgrade to correctly work, make sure you have opened the URLs in the proxy for **Azure AD Connect Health** as documented in [Office 365 URLs and IP address ranges ](https://support.office.com/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2).

If the **Synchronization Service Manager** UI is running on the server, then the upgrade will be suspended until the UI is closed.

## Troubleshooting
If your Connect installation does not upgrade itself as expected, then follow these steps to find out what could be wrong.

First, you should not expect the automatic upgrade to be attempted the first day a new version is released. There is an intentional randomness before an upgrade is attempted so don't be alarmed if your installation isn't upgraded immediately.

If you think something is not right, then first run `Get-ADSyncAutoUpgrade` to ensure automatic upgrade is enabled.

Start the eventlog and look in the **Application** eventlog. Add an eventlog filter for the source **Azure AD Connect Upgrade** and the event id range **300-399**.  
![Eventlog filter for automatic upgrade](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-feature-automatic-upgrade/eventlogfilter.png)  

This will give you the eventlogs associated with the status for automatic upgrade.  
![Eventlog filter for automatic upgrade](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-feature-automatic-upgrade/eventlogresult.png)  

The first half of the result will give you an overview of the state.

| Result Prefix | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Success | The installation was successfully upgraded. |
| UpgradeAborted | A temporary condition stopped the upgrade. It will be retried again and the expectation is that it will succeed. |
| UpgradeNotSupported | The system has a configuration which is blocking the system from being automatically upgraded. It will be retried to see if the state is changing, but the expectation is that the system must be upgraded manually. |

Here is a list of the most common messages you will find. It does not list all, but the result message should be clear with what the problem is.

| Result Message | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **UpgradeAborted** | |
| UpgradeAbortedSyncExeInUse | The [synchronization service manager UI](active-directory-aadconnectsync-service-manager-ui.md) is open on the server.
| UpgradeAbortedInsufficientDiskSpace | There is not enough disc space to support an upgrade. |
| UpgradeAbortedSyncCycleDisabled | The SyncCycle option in the [scheduler](active-directory-aadconnectsync-feature-scheduler.md) has been disabled. |
| UpgradeAbortedSyncOrConfigurationInProgress | The installation wizard is running or a sync was scheduled outside the scheduler. |
| **UpgradeNotSupported** | |
| UpgradeNotSupportedCustomizedSyncRules | You have added your own custom rules to the configuration. |

| UpgradeNotSupportedMetaverseSizeExceeeded | You have more than 100,000 objects in the metaverse. |
